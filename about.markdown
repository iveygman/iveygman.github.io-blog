<p>I'm a jack-of-all-trades kind of guy. My undergraduate career focused on embedded systems. 
My graduate career focused on signal processing (audio being one area of focus). My first job out of school started out 
with me working on operational amplifiers and comparators, then evolved into me doing both hardware and software design for
light sensors. Now I work as a software developer, building whatever needs to be built.</p>

<p>So I don't sound like a one-dimensional workaholic, my spare time involves: gaming (<a href="http://dotawallpaper.org/7-rhasta-shadow-shaman-dota-2-wallpaper-1.htm/rhasta-shadow-shaman-dota-2-wallpaper-6">DotA 2 bloodcyka</a>), working out 
when I can, traveling, eating tasty food, going on hikes, drinking bubble tea, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>, reading stuff on the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/">SCP Foundation</a>,
watching let's play videos on YouTube and learning random new things. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/iveygman">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>This site will probably feature primarily technical posts, but I may post photos from travels or other things as well</p>
