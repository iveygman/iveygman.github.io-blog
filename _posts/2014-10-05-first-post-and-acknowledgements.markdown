Alright, after some tribulations I've gotten this thing started. First things first, I want to acknowledge [Robert Birnie and his site
Uberobert](http://uberobert.com) for being the basis for the layout I'm using here. I'd never used Jekyll before, so it was a great reference.

You can reference my code via my [Github account](https://github.com/iveygman/iveygman.github.io). One of these days, I'll post a tutorial
of how I set it up.
