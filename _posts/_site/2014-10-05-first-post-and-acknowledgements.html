<p>Alright, after some tribulations I’ve gotten this thing started. First things first, I want to acknowledge <a href="http://uberobert.com">Robert Birnie and his site
Uberobert</a> for being the basis for the layout I’m using here. I’d never used Jekyll before, so it was a great reference.</p>

<p>You can reference my code via my <a href="https://github.com/iveygman/iveygman.github.io">Github account</a>. One of these days, I’ll post a tutorial
of how I set it up.</p>
